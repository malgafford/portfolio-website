          <h2> Objective </h2>
          <p>Design an iOS and Android version of a native mobile app that solves a specific user problem.</p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Users want to track their daily moods and habits to better take control of their life.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Create an iOS and Android native app to track moods, habits, and journal.</p>

          <h2>Discover</h2>
          <p>I did a competitive analysis and visual research.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-4">
          <h2>Ideate</h2>
          <p>I created a user flow diagram, sketched, and created mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-4">
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>I designed prototypes, high-fidelity wireframes, and mockups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column col-4">
          <h2>Test</h2>
          <p>I tested mid-fidelity wireframes and prototypes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>I conducted a competitive analysis on the mood tracking apps Daylio and DailyBean. A few pros of these apps were that they were simple and easy to use, personalized designs, and user-friendly. Some cons I found were several ads and premium
          features.</p>
        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <p>After conducting competitive research, I decided to incorporate personalization and a friendly for the app. A key feature for the app is to be able to customize your moods icons to a color theme. I picked the use of friendly robot
          illustrations to let users know they are not robots and they are allowed to record their feelings. The main color I chose to incorporate for the app is blue, mainly light blue because it is associated with health, healing, understanding,
          and softness. Blue is also calming and helps with balance and self-expression.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>User Flow Diagram</h2>
      <p>I created a user flow diagram to give an overview of how the user will go through the app.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>After sketching, I went into creating mid-fidelity wireframes for iOS and Android.</p>

      </picture>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>I created a prototype with the mid-fidelity wireframes. I tested users on the key functions of the app and general flow. The users felt that Send Moods needed some more brand development and they enjoyed the interactions. After the user
        testing, I incorporated their feedback into the design.</p>

      <h1>The Final Product</h1>
      <p>Once the high-fidelity wireframes were created, mockups of the final product were created.</p>
      <h2>Prototype</h2>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <h3>What went well?</h3>
      <p>I was successful in creating a simple, calming design with personality. I believe the message that you are not a robot and that you can express yourself is included. I enjoyed prototyping and the interactivity.</p>
      <h3>What were the challenges?</h3>
      <p>Originally I thought designing a mood tracker app would be simple, but after conducting competitor research and reading user reviews, I realized that my app needed to include additional features such as tracking habits, and journaling. It
        was also a challenge to design a version for both Android and iOS; it was double the work.
        To overcome these challenges, I made sure to use my time efficiently. I incorporated a theme between the two versions with only slight design differences based on the iOS and Material guidelines.</p>
      <h3>What would you do differently?</h3>
      <p>I would have liked to perform a usability test where I could evaluate the user on how they performed certain user flows. Getting feedback from this type of test could improve my design.
        Additionally I would look at common UI patterns to incorporate such as a floating action button to improve my design.</p>
