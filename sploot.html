  <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
  <p>To get a better representation of each screen and flow, detail and context was added to the low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

  </picture>
  <h2>User Testing</h2>
  <p>I conducted a usability test where users were given a scenario and evaluated on if they were able to complete the task. Users were encouraged to talk through their thinking process and give feedback on the overall feel and functionality of the design.</p>
  <p><b>Scenario</b>: You are a user who wants to search for dog treats and filter the results by customer rating. What steps are you taking to accomplish this task?</p>
  <p><b>Analysis</b>: Once the testing was complete, I took my notes from the testing and analyzed the results I created a table with the users' pain points and my solutions.</p>
