      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I researched users and competitors to determine the 5 why's for this product.</p>


        <h2>The 5 Why's</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>This tool is for people who want to shop for pet products without going into a physical store. The users want a clean, fun, and dynamic experience while shopping for pet products. Sploot is for anyone who has a special pet in their life.
        </p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>A web app that provides users a hassle free shopping experience. This tool allows users to browse inventory, purchase products, save products, have producats curated for them, and leave reviews.</p>
        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>This product will be used most often on commutes to and from work, in the evenings, during lunch breaks, and on weekends.</p>
        <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>Users can easly shop from anywhere they can connect to the internet, whether on a mobile device or on a desktop.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Users don't have the time or ability to visit physical stores and would rather buy their goods on the go or from home. Sploot privdes a centralized location where users can have products picked out for them.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        <p>I began the ideation phase by determining 3 key features for this app and sketching out those key functions. To create an MVP for this app, I decided on 3 key functions that the user will need in order to have a good user experience.
          Once the key functions were determined, I did quick sketches of the user flows.</p>
        <h3>Key Functions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>As a new customer, I want to be able to sign up for the product, and receive personalized recommendations.</li>
          <li>As a customer, I want to be able to place multiple items in a shopping cart, so that I can purchase more than one item at a time.</li>
          <li>As a customer, I want to search for products, and have access to advanced filtering options, so that I don't have to browse through a lot of products to find what I'm looking for.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>After rough sketching, I moved into creating user flow diagrams and low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>To get a better representation of each screen and flow, detail and context was added to the low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>I conducted a usability test where users were given a scenario and evaluated on if they were able to complete the task. Users were encouraged to talk through their thinking process and give feedback on the overall feel and functionality
          of
          the design.</p>
        <p><b>Scenario</b>: You are a user who wants to search for dog treats and filter the results by customer rating. What steps are you taking to accomplish this task?</p>
        <p><b>Analysis</b>: Once the testing was complete, I took my notes from the testing and analyzed the results I created a table with the users' pain points and my solutions.</p>
        <p>Check out the user research and prototype <a href="files/userResearchSploot" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>After user testing, I incorporated my user's feedback and my solutions to their pain points in the final design.</p>

        <h2>Syleguide</h2>
        <p>I created a styleguide for Sploot in order to keep the design consistent throughout the product.</p>
